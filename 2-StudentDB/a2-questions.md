## Assignment 2 Questions

#### Directions
Please answer the following questions and submit in your repo for the second assignment.  Please keep the answers as short and concise as possible.

1. In this assignment I asked you provide an implementation for the `get_student(...)` function because I think it improves the overall design of the database application.   After you implemented your solution do you agree that externalizing `get_student(...)` into it's own function is a good design strategy?  Briefly describe why or why not.

    > **Answer**:  I think moving the get_student() function into its own separate function is a good idea. It helps make the code cleaner and easier to manage. Instead of repeating the same code to fetch student records in different places, we can just call this one function whenever we need it. It makes everything more organized and less cluttered, which also makes it easier to fix or improve things later on without messing with other parts of the code.

2. Another interesting aspect of the `get_student(...)` function is how its function prototype requires the caller to provide the storage for the `student_t` structure:

    ```c
    int get_student(int fd, int id, student_t *s);
    ```

    Notice that the last parameter is a pointer to storage **provided by the caller** to be used by this function to populate information about the desired student that is queried from the database file. This is a common convention (called pass-by-reference) in the `C` programming language. 

    In other programming languages an approach like the one shown below would be more idiomatic for creating a function like `get_student()` (specifically the storage is provided by the `get_student(...)` function itself):

    ```c
    //Lookup student from the database
    // IF FOUND: return pointer to student data
    // IF NOT FOUND: return NULL
    student_t *get_student(int fd, int id){
        student_t student;
        bool student_found = false;
        
        //code that looks for the student and if
        //found populates the student structure
        //The found_student variable will be set
        //to true if the student is in the database
        //or false otherwise.

        if (student_found)
            return &student;
        else
            return NULL;
    }
    ```
    Can you think of any reason why the above implementation would be a **very bad idea** using the C programming language?  Specifically, address why the above code introduces a subtle bug that could be hard to identify at runtime? 

    > **ANSWER:** The local student variable is stored on the stack and will be destroyed once the function returns. This means the pointer returned by the function would point to a memory location that is no longer valid, causing undefined behavior when the caller tries to access the returned pointer.

3. Another way the `get_student(...)` function could be implemented is as follows:

    ```c
    //Lookup student from the database
    // IF FOUND: return pointer to student data
    // IF NOT FOUND or memory allocation error: return NULL
    student_t *get_student(int fd, int id){
        student_t *pstudent;
        bool student_found = false;

        pstudent = malloc(sizeof(student_t));
        if (pstudent == NULL)
            return NULL;
        
        //code that looks for the student and if
        //found populates the student structure
        //The found_student variable will be set
        //to true if the student is in the database
        //or false otherwise.

        if (student_found){
            return pstudent;
        }
        else {
            free(pstudent);
            return NULL;
        }
    }
    ```
    In this implementation the storage for the student record is allocated on the heap using `malloc()` and passed back to the caller when the function returns. What do you think about this alternative implementation of `get_student(...)`?  Address in your answer why it work work, but also think about any potential problems it could cause.  
    
    > **ANSWER:** The implementation using malloc() to allocate storage for the student structure works in that it avoids the issues with stack memory, allowing the caller to access the returned student structure after the function returns. However, the potential problem arises in the need to manage memory correctly. The caller must remember to free() the allocated memory to avoid memory leaks.


4. Lets take a look at how storage is managed for our simple database. Recall that all student records are stored on disk using the layout of the `student_t` structure (which has a size of 64 bytes).  Lets start with a fresh database by deleting the `student.db` file using the command `rm ./student.db`.  Now that we have an empty database lets add a few students and see what is happening under the covers.  Consider the following sequence of commands:

    ```bash
    > ./sdbsc -a 1 john doe 345
    > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 128 Jan 17 10:01 ./student.db
    > du -h ./student.db
        4.0K    ./student.db
    > ./sdbsc -a 3 jane doe 390
    > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 256 Jan 17 10:02 ./student.db
    > du -h ./student.db
        4.0K    ./student.db
    > ./sdbsc -a 63 jim doe 285 
    > du -h ./student.db
        4.0K    ./student.db
    > ./sdbsc -a 64 janet doe 310
    > du -h ./student.db
        8.0K    ./student.db
    > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 4160 Jan 17 10:03 ./student.db
    ```

    For this question I am asking you to perform some online research to investigate why there is a difference between the size of the file reported by the `ls` command and the actual storage used on the disk reported by the `du` command.  Understanding why this happens by design is important since all good systems programmers need to understand things like how linux creates sparse files, and how linux physically stores data on disk using fixed block sizes.  Some good google searches to get you started: _"lseek syscall holes and sparse files"_, and _"linux file system blocks"_.  After you do some research please answer the following:

    - Please explain why the file size reported by the `ls` command was 128 bytes after adding student with ID=1, 256 after adding student with ID=3, and 4160 after adding the student with ID=64? 

        > **ANSWER:** When you add students to the database, the file size increases because of how the file system handles storage. The file system works with fixed-size blocks, which are chunks of space used to store data. So, when you add a student record, it doesn’t just use exactly 64 bytes; instead, it may allocate space in blocks, which are typically larger than the data you're adding. For example, after adding the first student, the file size becomes 128 bytes because that’s the nearest block size the system can allocate. As you continue adding records, the file size increases as the system reserves more blocks to store the data, which can cause the file size to grow by larger amounts, even though the actual data being added is relatively small. This is why the file size increases in steps, often much larger than the amount of data you're adding.

    -   Why did the total storage used on the disk remain unchanged when we added the student with ID=1, ID=3, and ID=63, but increased from 4K to 8K when we added the student with ID=64? 

        > **ANSWER:** These students fit within the initially allocated blocks or sparse space, so the actual disk storage used (reported by du) doesn't change. The file size (ls) increases due to internal block allocations, but the disk usage stays low.For larger student IDs, the file might need to expand to accommodate more data. As more records are added, Linux may allocate additional blocks, resulting in an actual increase in disk storage, reflected by the change from 4K to 8K in du.

    - Now lets add one more student with a large student ID number  and see what happens:

        ```bash
        > ./sdbsc -a 99999 big dude 205 
        > ls -l ./student.db
        -rw-r----- 1 bsm23 bsm23 6400000 Jan 17 10:28 ./student.db
        > du -h ./student.db
        12K     ./student.db
        ```
        We see from above adding a student with a very large student ID (ID=99999) increased the file size to 6400000 as shown by `ls` but the raw storage only increased to 12K as reported by `du`.  Can provide some insight into why this happened?

        > **ANSWER:**  When adding a student with a large ID (like 99999), the file size (ls) increases to 6,400,000 bytes, but disk storage (du) increases only to 12K. This discrepancy happens because Linux uses sparse files. A sparse file contains "holes" or unallocated regions that are not physically stored on disk, even though the file appears large. When adding a student with such a large ID, the file system reserves space for the potential student record without actually writing data in those positions. Therefore, the ls command reports the total allocated space (which is quite large), but du reports the actual disk usage, which is minimal due to the sparsity.
